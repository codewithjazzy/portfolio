### LCSW Private Practice

A personal website for a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. It outlines her therapy focus, client focus, and types of therapy offered. The site also highlights her expertise with a direct link to her license verification.

With a focus on ease-of-use, there is a contact form and the site allows users to locate the practice with real-time directions via an interactive map link.
