### ThriveTribe

ThriveTribe is a compassionate web platform tailored specifically for Black women, Black women immigrants, and first-generation immigrant Black women, seeking a nurturing space to find therapists who not only share their racial identity but might also resonate with their cultural heritage. ThriveTribe bridges the gap between cultural understanding and mental health support, offering a personalized and inclusive approach to finding the right therapeutic alliance.
